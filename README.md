<h1>Welcome to my elevator simulator!</h1>
<h3>This project is a React JS based Elevator Simulator!</h3>

<h2>How to use the elevator</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You will start on the 4th floor with a button to call the elevator</li>
  <li>Once you call the elevator, you will see which floor the elevator is on in the ticker displayed above the elevator doors</li>
  <li>Once the elevator gets to your floor the doors will open</li>
  <li>You'll have the option to go to any of the other 3 floors by pressing one of their buttons</li>
  <li>When you press a floor button, the window will scroll (smoothly if you're in firefox) to the floor you press</li>
  <li>You'll see the elevators progress as it gets to you on the new floor above the doors</li>
  <li>You can also scroll to any of the other floors and call the elevator from there</li>
</ul>
